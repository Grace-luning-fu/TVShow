Create a TV Show database 

 

There are so many TV shows, and so little time. 

Create a database that helps users find TV shows by genre and duration so they can make the most use of their time. 

Each TV show entry should require the following information: 

- Name

- Number of seasons to date 

- Summary /teaser

- Genre 

- Duration (in minutes)

 

Create an application to save details about TV shows and list them. 

Allow a user to search by genre

Allow a user to search by duration 

Allow a user to search for words in the summary

 

Bonus points: 

- When a user clicks on a title in the list, show the user the details of that TV show. 

- Allow a user to search for a minimum and/or maximum number of seasons 

- Allow user to search for a minimum and/or maximum duration
